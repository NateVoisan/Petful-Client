      <h2>Adopt a furry new friend today!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Petful. In this adoption center, we put up pets for families
        looking to make a new permanent friend for life whether it be a cat or a
        dog! The current dog and cat up for adoption will be displayed on the
        next screen along with a list of people waiting to adopt.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        As new pets come in, we add them to the end of the list to be adopted.
        Pets that arrive first will be the first up for adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can add their name to the end of the list to sign up and adopt a
        pet. Once you are at the top of the list, you may select either a cat or
        a dog. Be wary that you may only adopt either the cat or dog that is
        currently up for adoption.
